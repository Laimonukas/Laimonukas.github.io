# Wine Quality Regression

This project is a regression problem where the goal is to predict the quality of wine. The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). The dataset was fitted to a Linear Regression model and the results were analyzed. The model was not the best choice for this dataset and the reasons were discussed in the project.
